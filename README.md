# 402 self-directed research studies - Topic Modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on ICU photovoice transcripts  
supervised by Dr. Howard at ubc

## Project Overview

This project analyzes transcripts from intensive care unit (ICU) survivors using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. We aim to identify the challenges people experience after hospitalization that might contribute to an unplanned readmission. This research is part of a qualitative study led by Dr. Fuchsia Howard at the UBC School of Nursing.


- **Photovoice Study**: A qualitative research method that allows past ICU patients to share their stories and perspectives through photography and narratives.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Applying techniques such as topic modelling to analyze patient transcripts and identify common themes and sentiments.

## Objectives

1. **Identify Challenges**: Uncover the specific challenges ICU survivors face after hospitalization.
2. **Promote Patient-Centered Care**: Use patient narratives to shape healthcare decisions and treatment plans.
3. **Quantify Struggles**: Employ data-driven techniques to demonstrate the magnitude of post-ICU journeys.

## Techniques and Methods

### Topic Modelling

Topic modelling is used to discover abstract topics or themes within the transcripts. We use the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm for this purpose:

- **LDA Algorithm**: A statistical model that assigns words to topics and topics to documents probabilistically. It identifies patterns and structures from the data itself without requiring labeled data.
  - **Probabilistic Assignment**: Words are assigned to topics and topics to documents based on probability distributions.
  - **Parameter Estimation**: The algorithm learns by estimating and updating parameters, such as topic-word distributions and document-topic distributions.
